/*

* Needed for `@mui` libraries while using `useEsModules` compiler option.
* There will be next error without this WA:
*
*   Did you mean 'index.js'?
*   BREAKING CHANGE: The request '@mui/base/Slider' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
*   (probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
*   The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
*   Add the extension to the request.
*
*
* Explanation:
*   MUI libraries don't provide "export" field in `package.json`. At the same time, Kotlin Wrappers for MUI libraries do not use fully specified imports.
*   But fully specified imports are required for Webpack with "es" module kind enabled.
*
* Thus it can be removed in the future when "export" field will be declared in `package.json` of every MUI library, or MUI Kotlin Wrappers will use fully specified imports.
