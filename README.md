# Campus QR
Due to the current situation around the COVID-19 pandemic, Studo developed an open source system for contact tracing at universities.
When entering a lecture hall or seminar room, students and teachers can scan a QR code attached to the door or in the entrance area.
Campus QR allows creation and management of those QR codes.
An optimal implementation in terms of data protection and security are goals of this project.

Campus QR can additionally be used as access management system: Access to locations like department buildings is only granted by explicit invite.
Users scan the QR code attached to the entrance.
If access is granted, a unique animation with access information is shown at the users mobile device to allow entrance by a doorman or web-hook based door unlocking systems.
Access control or successful check-ins can also be verified by an employee during a lecture in bulk, so lecturers can validate within seconds if hundreds of students have successfully checked in.

The system is open source and can be hosted by the university itself.
The web app is available as stand-alone application.
The [Studo app](https://studo.com) integrates the provided Android and iOS reference implementation to allow offline dispatching of check-in events.

* **Exportable**: Check-ins at specific locations and check-ins from specific people can be downloaded as csv file to open them in Excel.
* **Infection tracing**: Fast and reliable tracing of infection chains. 
* **Automatic data deletion**: After a configurable time (default: 4 weeks) the check-in data will be automatically deleted to comply with the GDPR.
* **Multipermission administration**: The moderation frontend of Campus QR can be used by thousands of employees of a university.
* **Access management**: Creation of specific access for students or guests within selected time frame to allow a controlled reopening of university buildings.
* **Visitor list export**: Simple doorman specific interface with upcoming access permits
* **Scalable access verification**: Access control can be verified by a doorman or lecturer in parallel to avoid crowds around entries. A unique access verification code is generated daily for easy parallel verification.
* **External identity management**: SSO, LDAP (using JNDI) and OAuth2 are supported by Ktor authentication packages and fully configurable LDAP integration.
* **Logging**: Optional User-Agent and IP address logging for auditing. (Disabled by default - privacy by default)
* **API access**: A *shared key* can be optionally defined to grant admin access to external services: Add the `X-Authorization: [authSharedSecret]` header to the request to authenticate as administrator (sharedSecretUser).
* **E-Mail restriction**: Definition which e-mail addresses can be entered on check-in to force university email addresses.
* **Manual check out**: Users can check out by scanning the check-in QR code again or scanning a generic check-out QR code.
* **Automatic check out**: In case users forget to check-out, they get automatically checked-out after a configurable amount of minutes have passed.
* **Multi check in**: Locations can contain sublocations: Users can check-in in whole buildings and then further check-in in rooms inside the building.
* **Seat support**: A QR code can be generated for whole locations (like rooms or buildings) or per seat (e.g. one QR code per lecture hall seat).
* **Seat filtering**: With enabled seat support, potentially affected people can be filtered by their seats. This allows differentiating between two types of contacts:
  * "K1 contact": People who were in direct contact with an infected person.
  * "K2 contact": People who where only in the same location and time but sat far away to the infected person.

## Managed hosting features
Campus QR can be hosted by the university itself or by [Studo](https://studo.com). When hosted by Studo, the following hosting features are available per default: 
* **Horizontal application scaling**: By running several API nodes in parallel, the application infrastructure can be scaled to as many nodes as required.
* **Zero-downtime operations**: Deployment, container restarts and upgrades are zero-downtime operations: New containers have to be available first, before stopping the old containers.
* **Automatic security updates**: Containers apply OS and JVM security updates with zero downtime.
* **Real time metrics and logs**: Application nodes and database nodes allow easy monitoring and auditing.
* **Scalable database infrastructure**: The MongoDB database runs in high availability mode (replicaset) with 2 active data nodes, 1 backup node and 1 arbiter to ensure zero downtime (99.96% uptime guaranteed by SLA).
* **Dockerized database containers**: Database servers are dedicated processes sealed in docker containers. It allows seamless database upgrades with zero downtime if more space or memory is required.
* **Database backups**: Daily automated encrypted backups with retention policies to auto-delete old backups.
* **Database security**: SSL connections and Encryption-at-Rest are enabled per default.
* **Optimal database performance**: SSD-like performance on SAN-backed dedicated MongoDB processes.
* **Dedicated expect care and support**: Your application will be manged by an expert team that handles an infrastructure with more than 10.000 requests per minute.
* **GDPR compliant**: Hosted in the EU on ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified datacenter infrastructure.

# Self hosting

## Setup

The following environment variables need to be configured:

* `PORT` (default: `8070`): Port where the web application will listen to
* `HOST` (default: `0.0.0.0`): By default the web application is accessible from every host. Set it to `127.0.0.1` if the web application
  should only be accessible from localhost.
* `MONGO_URI` (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/campus-qr)`: Database URI to store further configuration, locations, check-ins and
  moderation users. Make sure that the database is either not accessible from another host or provide authentication parameters in the URI.

## Development compilation

Start the backend application by the IntelliJ run configuration **Server** or alternatively with `./gradlew server:run`. After having the
backend running, start the moderator frontend application by the IntelliJ run configuration **Debug Web-Frontend** or alternatively
with `./gradlew browserDevelopmentRun -t`. You can now access the moderator frontend with the proxied local backend
via https://localhost:8072. When debugging with the **Debug Web-Frontend** run configuration, you can also set breakpoints in IntelliJ while
testing the web-frontend in the newly opened Chrome window (first compilation might take a while). Hot reloading of the moderator web
frontend is also enabled.

## Production compilation

Build the whole application with `./gradlew stage` to run it with `java -jar Server.jar`. This also compiles the moderator frontend and
bundles it into the jar.

## First time setup

The default admin email address is `admin@example.org` with password `admin`. Please change it immediately after your first login to the
moderation frontend.

Change at least the following values in the `configurations` collection in the connected MongoDB. Note that this collection will be
automatically created after the first launch of the application:

* `userTosUrl_en` / `userTosUrl_de`: Links at the check-in view.
* `imprintUrl_en` / `imprintUrl_de`: Links at the check-in view.
* `baseUrl`: Needed for CORS protection and logout redirect URL.
* `qrCodeBaseUrl`: URL prefix for generating QR codes. White-labeling, LDAP configuration, privacy settings and further configuration
  parameters can also be tweaked by changing the appropriate `stringValue` and `intValue` in the `configurations` collection.

## Deployment
When self-hosting Campus QR, create a setup that ensures at least weekly updates of the upstream source code to quickly react on updates.

### Deployment on generic PaaS with Procfile
This repository provides a generic `Procfile` for easy deployment to most **PaaS** providers like [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com). 

Calling the `stage` gradle task (`./gradlew stage`) will build a *fat jar* in `Server.jar`. This jar file already contains the **moderation frontend**. If your **PaaS** provider calls a different build task, inject the `stage` task as dependency there.

The server assumes that the PaaS provider provides all necessary environment variables mentioned in the [Setup](#Setup) section.

### Deployment on self-hosted hardware with Docker
Adjust the provided sample **Dockerfile** and define all necessary environment variables mentioned in the [Setup](#Setup) section.

# Project structure
This Git repository is a Kotlin Multiplatform Project using Gradle. Opening the project in IntelliJ works out of the box.

## Server
For the backend the project uses [Kotlin for Server-side Development](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/server-overview.html) by running on the JVM. Supported JVM versions are JVM 11 LTS and the latest JVM version. This backend code is located in the subfolder *server/src/main* and uses shared code from *common/src/commonMain*.

## User Frontend
The user frontend allows checking in with a QR code. This module is HTML5 based, the mobile optimized HTML5 is generated by the server. The user frontend communicates via HTTPS request with the server.

## Moderation Frontend
The moderation frontend allows creation of new QR codes, QR code management and user notifications. This module is a React project using [Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html) to generate the JavaScript code that runs in a web browser. The moderation frontend communicates via HTTPS API calls with the server. The moderation frontend code is located in the subfolder *moderatorFrontend/src/main* and uses shared code from *common/src/commonMain*.

## Android reference implementation
The native Android reference implementation to scan QR codes is provided in the subfolder *campus-qr-android* and might be used by Android applications to allow scanning the QR codes while being offline and dispatching the check-in event when being online again.

## iOS reference implementation
The native iOS reference implementation to scan QR codes is provided in the subfolder *campus-qr-ios* and might be used by iOS applications to allow scanning the QR codes while being offline and dispatching the check-in event when being online again.

## Code Style Guide
The project follows the official [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) with two additions: Line wrap is 140 characters, and indentation is 2 instead of 4 spaces (continuation indent is 4 instead of 8 spaces) on all file types.
